- Lens bracked width was wrong; should have measured before printing. This was really not very smart on my part tbh, but its good to get a print out and see what needs fixed / what works.
- From eyeballing it, looks like the height of the light mount needs to be 1.5cm taller for the led to be vertically centered in the lens
- Rigidity is really good with these settings. Triangle stronk. Will try 10% infill instead of 100%; the arms / important parts of the mount would still be solid because of the high wall count but the riser block can be hollow I think
- Adhesion was fine. I usually use rafts for everything, but because of the size I couldn't fit it onto the build plate, and I was worried the lack of adhesion support would be an issue. All good, so good.

Changes / Updates for Next Print:
- Lens Bracked width fixed (140mm now, as it should be)
- Light mount height offset increased from 0 to 15mm
- Infill Density changed from 100% to 10%
