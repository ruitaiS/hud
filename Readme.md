### Notes:
I forgot to check the lens bracket width before printing it, so it didn't actually fit. Fixed it now, but it was kind of a foolish oversight. Not a total waste of time though; it was good to at least see a rough version irl and see what works and what needs fixed. The light mount was 15mm low after checking with a ruler; I'd originally calculated it by doing the height minus half the diameter of the housing, but it was easier to get a more accurate reading off the print. The rigidity is really good; triangles are really strong, so I'm pretty happy about that. A future project might be an analysis on the strength of different sized struts under tension / compression / bending, but for now good enough is good enough. Next print I'll try 10% infill; the struts and mounting points will still be solid because of the high wall count, but it'll save some time/material not filling in the bigger blocks. Build plate adhesion was fine; I was concerned because I couldn't fit a raft due to size constraints, but it turned out okay, so great.
