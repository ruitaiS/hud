### Notes:
- Lens bracket width was wrong; should have measured in CAD before printing. Oops.
- Light mount moved up 15mm to properly center led in the lens
- Rigidity is good. Trying 10% infill next print to save on time; struts + mount points will still be solid b/c of the high wall count, so should be ok.
- Adhesion is good. Couldn't fit a raft b/c of the size, and was concerned. All good though, so good.

### Changes / Updates for Next Print:
- Lens Bracked width fixed (140mm now, as it should be)
- Light mount height offset increased from 0 to 15mm
- Infill Density changed from 100% to 10%
